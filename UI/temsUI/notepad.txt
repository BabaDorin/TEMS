Currently working on:
    Attach Detach feature.

Major bugs to be solved:
    1. Fix summary analytics data (some data are not correct);
    2. Archieved items should not prevent in any way creation of new items (for example, if an item is created with
    a temsID which also belongs to an archieved item, there should not be any problem in created that item. To prevent 
    temsid duplicates, when dearcheving an item, it's temsid is checked and if there is another, un-archieved item with the
    same temsid, the temsid of the items that is being dearchieved will be suffixed by a [dearchieved] tag).
    3. Upload to library does not work.4
    4. Report Signatories => an invalid entry appears out of nowhere 
    

===>>> 29.05
    Create personnel-user association within add-personnel view.
    Style personnel
    style allocations
    style quick access

IMPORTANT NOTES:
--> EquipmentType => Children, EquipmentDefinition => children are not configured with DeleteBehaviour.Cascade.
    Therefore, this should be accomplished
    manually after propting the user if we wants to keep child types. (In case if a child type can exist
    on his own). Also, note that an eq type can be child for more than one parent.
    All of the above are valid for definition too. (Actually it's valid for equipment to, but in this the Cascade
    is implemented, user will have to deatach children equipment if he wants to keep them.); 

TODO
------------ As soon as possible >>>>

archieve => archive

when updating the report template, no columns are displayed.

// Nice to have
Add some text animation (svg) when users stays on home page for more than 10 minutes straight

study:
async constructor (factory)

// Analytics:
--> Check the 'getEquipmentAmount' of entities (rooms, equipment), there might be a problem with getting the 
last allocation.

// TD:
--> Detached a child equipment and could not attach it back (error snackbar), but then it worked. Idk why
--> when adding or updating entities, the api should return the edited / added object via additional property of
    reponse. Use this approach to display feedback
--> integrate Qr
--> Clean formlyservice
--> Move type related methods to typeservice and definition related to definition and clean equipment service (clean all of them actually)
--> Add property length limits
--> Update equipment does not work!!!!!!!!!
--> smart load mat tab
--> Error when closing the allocation
--> Make closing the active allocation easier (Ex. from equipment details page, like a quick action)
--> Description property is always considered as desired specific property, idk why (report);
--> Find a way to pass unitofwork to scheduler
--> remove teamviewer id from definition, add it to item description
--> Email confirmation + password reset via email
--> Add generic AgGridItems Component
--> Better UX when dealing with reports (For ex >> Redirect to listing after adding a report and other).
--> Add oncascadedeleete
--> Forbid circular refference for types and definitions
--> IMPORTANT: test update definitions!
--> If an equipment is child for another, the first one will be 'included' in the second one, which means that
    it won't be possible to allocate only children equipment. In order to do that, it should be first deatached from
    the parent, and only then will be possible to use it like a non-child equipment. (1: Hide 'allocate' tab
    for children, and treat this case on backend). 
--> Implement temslogger
--> There are two methods with similar implementation within TicketController (GetTickets and GetTicketsOfEntity),
    get rid of one
--> Improve the logic of keys moving from one to another table
--> ChipsAutocompleteComponent needs some refactoring. The NG Value accessor does not work as supposed. For intance,
    when the initial value is set via alreadySelected, the value that goes to the client FormControl is null.
    Only after adding or removing one item, the value refreshes and starts to reflect the real state.
    The current overcome for this problem is assigning the initial value both via [alreadySelected] input parameter
    and formControl initial value (like keys: new FormControl(alreadySelectedKeys)).
    If a formControl represents an instance of ChipsAutocompleteComponent, then it should reflet the real state 
    anytime.



    ** Components currently affected by this: EquipmentAllocation, KeysAllocation.
--> There are a lot of renundant code snippets (Like GetAllAutocompleteOptions) on backend that needs to be extracted
    to a sepparate class, service, controller or helper in order to end up with a more maintainable codebase.
--> Move all of the ViewModel validation logic from backend controllers inside the ViewModels' types. 
--> When sending an email, make sure an email is not being sent more than once to a single email address (For example,
    when there are 2 or more personnel records having the same email, send the message only once.)
--> Some entities' identitifer properties return data that does not present much value (Like: Personnel: [And no personnel inserted here]);
    Do some includes where necessary, but do not exagerate.
--> Server-side paging & filtering, especially for equipment.

------------ Future >>>>

--> Solve spelling mistakes:
    Equipments => Equipment (Equipment has no plural form)
--> Write and read url parameters (representing key, personnel or room filters) within ViewKeyAllocationComponent
    in order to offer the possibility of getting some route snapshots that can be sent to other people and the filters
    be set automatically when they'll open the url. 
--> Implement server-side filtering for AttachEquipmentComponent.
--> When updating a definition, if it has some children then for all of the children the definition will be selected
    from the dropdown and all of the fields will be disabled. Basically you have to find a way to call the change 
    function when the value of identifierSelect changes.

---- Requires testing

// Tickets
Add pinned ticket feature
----> move ui logic of close, reopen, change issues status to issueContainer and emmit necessary events just for passing
      indexes to the entity-issues-list.
      Add support for getting issue statuses from both ways => from API or from input parameter
      Add pin icon and make api calls
      

------------ Solved >>>>

--> Fix archieving for types, properties, definitions etc. (The endpoint frontent communicates with is not valid)
--> Error when fetching properties
--> Add IsEditable to viewmodel and restrict user from editin non-editable properties and types (inputs are disabled)
--> Provided email is already in use (User - settings) when turning on email notifications
--> Dearchive does not work (no logic added)
--> Improve archieve
--> Add pagination to reports, library
--> Display custom properties (equipment)
--> Remove deatached from attached if it has been attached back =)
--> Fix spelling mistakes SIC Integration
-->  Attach - deatach children equipment (For example, when replacing components)
--> Treat indexes properrly when using pagination on properties and types

--> Improve the archivation logic by making the DateArchieved nullable and by using the new approach (SetArchivationStatus) 
    when setting the archivation status of an item.
