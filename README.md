**TEMS** is a comprehensive, multi-tenant ITSM (IT Service Management) platform designed to orchestrate the complete lifecycle of corporate digital assets. From high-performance workstations to mobile devices, TEMS provides a centralized, cloud-native command center for the modern enterprise.

### 🌐 Global Infrastructure, Local Control
Built as a subscription-based cloud application, TEMS scales with your business. Whether you are a startup or a global corporation, our flexible bundling ensures you only pay for the modules you need.

* **Multi-Tenant Architecture:** Secure, isolated environments for every client.
* **Global Hierarchy:** Manage unlimited locations and branches. Define your organization by **Country → City → Location** to maintain a centralized view of a decentralized workforce.
* **Enterprise Security:** Seamlessly integrate with your existing Identity Provider (IdP) via **Keycloak** for secure, single-sign-on (SSO) access.

### 🔄 The Full Asset Lifecycle
TEMS ensures complete visibility from the moment a device is conceived to the day it is decommissioned.

1.  **Planning:** Analyze current inventory trends to forecast future hardware needs and budget requirements accurately.
2.  **Procurement:** Track orders, vendor contracts, and shipping statuses to ensure assets are ready for onboarding the moment they arrive.
3.  **Deployment:** Seamlessly transition assets from "In-Stock" to "In-Use." Use **TEMS ACC** for instant device enrollment.
4.  **Maintenance:** Monitor real-time health and performance metrics to perform proactive repairs and software updates, minimizing downtime.
5.  **Retirement:** Manage the secure decommissioning, data wiping, and environmentally responsible disposal of aging hardware.

### ⚡ Intelligent Monitoring with TEMS ACC
The **TEMS ACC** client application is installed on every workstation to act as a telemetry bridge. It collects and streams vital metrics—including **CPU usage, RAM health, and system properties**—to our server-side AI.

* **Transparent History:** Every asset maintains a "Paper Trail of Truth." Every assignment, status change (e.g., from *Procurement* to *Defect*), and update is logged for a fully auditable history.
* **Actionable Insights:** Technicians gain immediate visibility into the system state, allowing for rapid diagnostics and data-driven decision-making.

### 🎫 Integrated Ticket Management
TEMS bridges the gap between users and administrators with a robust ticketing engine aligned with **ITIL v3 and v4** standards. Users can raise tickets directly through the app to communicate with system administrators or AI agents.

| Ticket Type | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Incident** | An unplanned interruption or reduction in service quality. *Something is broken.* |
| **Security Incident** | A confirmed or suspected breach of security policy (e.g., Phishing, Malware). |
| **Service Request** | A formal request for something to be provided (e.g., access, hardware, info). |
| **Problem** | The underlying cause of one or more Incidents. *The disease, not just the symptom.* |
| **Change Request** | Any modification, addition, or removal that could affect IT services. |
| **Alert / Event** | Machine-generated notifications from external tools like AWS CloudWatch or Zabbix. |

### 🤖 The Core Vision: Agentic AI Resolution
The future of ITSM is autonomous. TEMS is built on the core philosophy that repetitive tasks should not consume human time. 

By leveraging **Agentic AI**, TEMS aims to automate up to **70% of support tickets**. Our AI agents utilize a deep knowledge base of previous fixes, budget data, and business rules to:
* **Self-Heal:** Resolve software issues and system errors automatically.
* **Auto-Provision:** Assign licenses and permissions based on predefined logic.
* **Optimize:** Free up your technical team to focus on high-value strategic initiatives that drive business growth.
