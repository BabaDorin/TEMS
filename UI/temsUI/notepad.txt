TODO
------------ As soon as possible >>>>

--> Solve spelling mistakes:
    Equipments => Equipment (Equipment has no plural form)

--> There are two methods with similar implementation within TicketController (GetTickets and GetTicketsOfEntity),
    get rid of one
    
--> Improve the logic of keys moving from one to another table

--> ChipsAutocompleteComponent needs some refactoring. The NG Value accessor does not work as supposed. For intance,
    when the initial value is set via alreadySelected, the value that goes to the client FormControl is null.
    Only after adding or removing one item, the value refreshes and starts to reflect the real state.
    The current overcome for this problem is assigning the initial value both via [alreadySelected] input parameter
    and formControl initial value (like keys: new FormControl(alreadySelectedKeys)).
    If a formControl represents an instance of ChipsAutocompleteComponent, then it should reflet the real state 
    anytime.
    ** Components currently affected by this: EquipmentAllocation, KeysAllocation.

--> There are a lot of renundant code snippets (Like GetAllAutocompleteOptions) on backend that needs to be extracted
    to a sepparate class, service, controller or helper in order to end up with a more maintainable codebase.

--> Move all of the ViewModel validation logic from backend controllers inside the ViewModels' types. 

--> When sending an email, make sure an email is not being sent more than once to a single email address (For example,
    when there are 2 or more personnel records having the same email, send the message only once.)

--> Some entities' identitifer properties return data that does not present much value (Like: Personnel: [And no personnel inserted here]);
    Do some includes where necessary, but do not exagerate.

--> Server-side paging & filtering, especially for equipment.

------------ Future >>>>

--> Write and read url parameters (representing key, personnel or room filters) within ViewKeyAllocationComponent
    in order to offer the possibility of getting some route snapshots that can be sent to other people and the filters
    be set automatically when they'll open the url.

------------ Solved >>>>

--> Improve the archivation logic by making the DateArchieved nullable and by using the new approach (SetArchivationStatus) 
    when setting the archivation status of an item.
