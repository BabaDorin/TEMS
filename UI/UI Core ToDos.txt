Angular 11 UI Development - Core ToDos.

-----< First Stage: Planning >-----

Before jumping to code, draw a diagram or something representing the architecture of
the temsUI Angular App.

Focus of these parts:
> The look of UI
> Components
> Services
> Libraries
> Other (To be completed along the way)

Use an online service to host the diagrams.


-----< Second Stage: Getting our hands dirty >-----

This comes right after planning. Take your diagrams and begin with creating the main components, models and services.
(Now we don't really care about the design).

Implement the look (a simple one, we will get back to design later, we need functionality now) and the logic of components.
Connect components to 'fake' services.

Make the app work with test data (Supply a relatively big amount of test data to work with.)

Focus on Begin GENERIC when working with data.

USE LAZY LOADING

DONT FORGET THAT AT ANY TIME ANOTHER PROJECT CAN BE CREATED SO DON'T HESITATE TO EXPERIMENT AND TRY STUFF.


-----< Third Stage: Make it look good. >-----

If we are here, it means that the components work like charm, so we have to make them look pretty.

First of all, choose a template (Like that one from udemy-leave-management).

Add menus and STUFF

Get inspiration from Leetcode.com


-----< Forth Stage: Test and Improve >------

At this point you should have the app's design in front of you, so you know better what 
test cases are necessary for the app. Test the app! and improve it, of course.

Note that after leaving this part you should end up with a reliable UI, without bugs and other artefacts.
It should work like charm. It will stay on hold until the API is done so we can connect them.
