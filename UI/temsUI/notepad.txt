TODO
--> Solve spelling mistakes:
    Equipments => Equipment (Equipment has no plural form)

--> There are two methods with similar implementation within TicketController (GetTickets and GetTicketsOfEntity),
    get rid of one
    
--> Improve the logic of keys moving from one to another table

--> ChipsAutocompleteComponent needs some refactoring. The NG Value accessor does not work as supposed. For intance,
    when the initial value is set via alreadySelected, the value that goes to the client FormControl is null.
    Only after adding or removing one item, the value refreshes and starts to reflect the real state.
    The current overcome for this problem is assigning the initial value both via [alreadySelected] input parameter
    and formControl initial value (like keys: new FormControl(alreadySelectedKeys)).
    If a formControl represents an instance of ChipsAutocompleteComponent, then it should reflet the real state 
    anytime.
    ** Components currently affected by this: EquipmentAllocation, KeysAllocation.
